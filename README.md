# 🎨 The Met - Companion App (Android)

This project is an unofficial mobile app that was designed and developed by a team of three developers as a collaborative learning project.

The app is based on the public API of The Metropolitan Museum of Art and aims to make art discovery more accessible through a modern, user-friendly mobile experience.

**The focus of the project was on:**
- exploring a real-world public API
- designing and implementing meaningful app flows for art discovery
- collaborative development and architecture decisions in a small team

The application allows users to browse artworks from The Met’s collection, explore details, and discover art in an intuitive, visually driven way.
All content is fetched dynamically via the museum’s official public API.

### 📂 Repository & Code

The full source code is maintained in a private GitHub organization repository, as this was a team project and not intended for public code sharing.
This repository therefore serves as a visual and conceptual showcase only, documented via a PDF presentation containing selected screens, flows, and explanations of our approach.

### 🤝 Team Collaboration

This project was developed together with two other developers.
All major decisions regarding concept, architecture, and implementation were made collaboratively, and the project reflects our shared work as a team.
